# ligo/base
This is a base container from which other LIGO containers should be derived. It
does no more than install the repositories which contain LIGO software. It
should not be used as a build environment.

Examples of derived containers:

* [LIGO Software Environment](https://hub.docker.com/r/ligo/lscsoft-all/)
* [LALSuite Build Environment](https://hub.docker.com/r/ligo/lalsuite-dev/)
